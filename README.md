# ClusterJob
Clusterjob, hereafter CJ, is an experiment management system (EMS) for data science. CJ is 
written mainly in perl and allows submiting computational jobs to clusters in a hassle-free and reproducible manner.
CJ produces 'reporoducible' computational packages for academic publications at no-cost. CJ project started in 2013 at Stanford University by Hatef Monajemi and his PhD advisor David L. Donoho with the goal of encouraging  more efficient and reproducible research paradigm. 
CJ is currently under active development. Current implementation allows submission of MATLAB,Python and R jobs. 
The code for R works partially for serial jobs only. In the future versions, we hope to include other data science 
programming languages such as Julia.

## Cluster configuration

Each cluster is described in the `ssh_config` file.  In addition to the existing
`Repo` entry that controls where run data is stored, you can optionally specify
`CondaRepo` to choose the directory where CJ installs Miniconda on that machine.
If omitted, `CondaRepo` defaults to the same path as `Repo`.
